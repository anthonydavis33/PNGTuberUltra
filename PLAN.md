# PNGTuberUltra — MVP Plan

The living source of truth for what we're building, why, and in what order. Update this as decisions change.

## Mission

A PNGTuber app that closes the UX and feature gap between PNGTuber+ and Live2D-class tools — without requiring rigged Live2D models. Webcam face tracking and a serious rigging editor are the differentiators; PNGTuber+ feature parity is the floor.

Built first for one specific user (a friend). Open source from day one because the license itself is a moat against the only existing GitHub-hosted competitor (PNGTuber Remix, which uses a custom non-OSI license).

## Non-goals (MVP)

Things we are deliberately not doing yet, so we don't drift:

- Live2D-rigged-model support (no parameter rigging on deformable meshes)
- Per-finger / IK / cloth physics
- Hand tracking, iPhone ARKit tracking
- Twitch / Discord / StreamElements integrations
- TTS, AI VTuber hooks
- Plugin marketplace
- Custom keyframe / node-graph animation editor (we ship simple tweens; node-graph is veadotube's paid tier — v2 for us)
- Mobile builds
- Telemetry, analytics, crash reporting
- i18n
- A formal community PR pipeline (PRs accepted at maintainer discretion, no SLA)

## Stack & rationale

- **Tauri** — app shell. Small native binary (~10MB), real file system access, global hotkeys when window unfocused, persistent OS mic/cam permissions, clean path to USB MIDI/gamepad later.
- **React + TypeScript** — UI. Best-in-class editor libraries (dnd-kit, react-flow when we need it, monaco) live here. Maintainer is fastest in this stack.
- **PixiJS** — canvas renderer. Hardware-accelerated 2D, mature sprite/filter pipeline, fits our "sprites + transforms + simple shaders" model exactly.
- **MediaPipe Tasks Vision** (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`) — webcam face tracking. Runs in-process JS. FaceLandmarker gives blendshapes (mouth open, brow raise, eyes closed) and 3D head pose. No GDExtension or Python sidecar pain.
- **Zustand** — app state. Lighter than Redux, fits a single-window app with one document open.
- **dnd-kit** — drag-drop for the layer tree.
- **Vite** — dev/build.

The core stack-shape decision: do face tracking in-process JS via MediaPipe rather than as a sidecar. This is the single biggest reason we picked the web stack over Godot.

## License & repo posture

- License: **MIT**
- Public on GitHub
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: PRs welcome but reviewed at maintainer discretion, no SLA, fork freely, no CLA
- No expectation of community management

## Core architecture

### The pipeline

```
Inputs → Bindings → Target values → Modifiers → Render
```

- **Inputs** publish signals every frame (continuous) or as discrete events
- **Bindings** map an input signal to a sprite property
- **Modifiers** post-process the bound value (parent, spring, drag, sine)
- **Render** draws PixiJS sprites with the final transforms

This is the architecture. Every feature in MVP and v2 ought to fit it. If it doesn't, that's a sign to either revise the architecture or push the feature.

### Inputs (MVP)

| Source   | Parameters                                                                                          | Kind                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Mic      | `Volume`                                                                                            | continuous          |
| Webcam   | `HeadYaw`, `HeadPitch`, `HeadRoll`, `MouthOpen`, `BrowRaise`, `GazeX`, `GazeY`, `EyesClosed`        | continuous          |
| Keyboard | `LastKey`, `KeyDown(key)`, `KeyRegion`                                                              | events + state      |
| Mouse    | `MouseX`, `MouseY`, `LeftDown`, `RightDown`                                                         | continuous + events |
| Hotkeys  | named state toggles, costume slots                                                                  | discrete state      |
| Timer    | `BlinkTimer`, idle bobs                                                                             | events              |

### Bindings (MVP)

A binding has:

- **Source**: one input parameter
- **Target**: one sprite property — `visible`, `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `frame` (sprite-sheet index), `alpha`
- **Mapping**:
  - `linear` — input range [a,b] mapped to output range [c,d]
  - `threshold` — output is on/off above a threshold (used for talking, brow raise → expression)
  - `state-table` — enum value → discrete output (used for `KeyRegion` → which paw)
  - `event-trigger` — event fires → play named animation

### Modifiers (MVP)

Stacked per-sprite, evaluated in order:

1. **Parent** — transform parented to another sprite. Must be first if present.
2. **Spring** — Hookean spring chases the target; stiffness + damping. Bounce/jiggle (hair, ears, tails, jewelry).
3. **Drag** — first-order lag toward target, no overshoot. Capes, scarves.
4. **Sine** — additive sinusoidal offset on any property; amplitude, frequency, phase. Idle breathing, hovering.

All hand-rolled. No physics engine dep — Matter.js / Rapier are overkill for this and pull in collision systems we don't want.

#### Parenting and render order are orthogonal

`Parent` is a transform-inheritance modifier, **not** a scene-graph relationship. All sprites remain flat children of the `world` container in PixiJS for rendering. The model `sprites` array determines render z-order, full stop. Parenting only composes transforms — head moves and hair follows because hair's world transform is computed as `compose(head.worldTransform, hair.localTransform)`, **not** because hair is a Pixi descendant of head.

This decoupling is what lets back-hair render behind the head while front-hair renders on top, even though both have `Parent: head`. If we made parenting a render-tree relationship (the naive Pixi-native approach), we'd lose the ability to interleave a parented sprite's z-order with its parent's siblings — exactly the pattern most 2D rigged avatars need.

Implementation: when applying a sprite's transform, walk the `Parent` chain and compose world transforms before any other modifier runs. `Parent` must be first in the stack so Spring/Drag/Sine see post-parent target values.

### Animations (MVP — simple tweens only)

- Triggered by event bindings (key region pressed, mic threshold crossed, hotkey, etc.)
- Definition: lerp property P from current value to target T over duration D ms, optionally return to baseline
- Easings: `linear`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `easeInOut`
- No custom keyframes, no timeline editor, no per-property curves — that's v2

This is what powers Bongo Cat-style typing animations: keyboard region event → tween paw Y by +20px over 80ms, return.

## Avatar data model

Avatar files are `.pnxr` — a zip containing:

- `manifest.json` — schema version, name, author, created/modified timestamps
- `model.json` — sprite tree, bindings, modifiers, animations, regions, hotkeys
- `assets/` — PNGs, sprite sheets

JSON-first, no binary. Diffable in git, importable without our app.

## Build phases

Each phase ends in something demoable internally before the next starts.

1. ✅ **Skeleton** — Tauri + React + Vite scaffold, PixiJS canvas, layer tree renders one PNG sprite, transform controls work end-to-end.
2. ✅ **Data model + simple inputs** — `model.json` parser, mic input + keyboard input + hotkey input wired to a generic input bus. Save/load round-trips a `.pnxr` model. *Shipped as 2a (PNG loading), 2b (mic + thresholds + phonemes), 2c (keyboard + regions + hotkeys), 2d (.pnxr persistence).*
3. ✅ **Bindings + modifiers + sprite sheets** — bindings drive sprite properties from inputs; all four modifiers implemented and stackable; sprite-sheet animation. *Shipped as 3a (visibility bindings), 3b (transform bindings, linear), 3c (parent / spring / drag / sine modifiers + anchor controls), 3d (Show On checkbox UX, drag-drop, per-pixel hits, keyboard shortcuts), 3e (sprite-sheet animation with cols/rows/fps/loop modes).*
4. **Webcam tracking + advanced sprite-sheet bindings** — combined phase, two related pieces:
   - **MediaPipe FaceLandmarker integration**: face tracking publishes new continuous channels to the input bus — `HeadYaw` / `HeadPitch` / `HeadRoll`, `MouthOpen`, `BrowRaise`, `GazeX` / `GazeY`, `EyesClosed`. New status-bar section + calibration / enable controls. Transform bindings now drive avatar from real head movement.
   - **Deferred 3f items rolled in here**: (a) `frame` as a `TransformTarget` so transform bindings can drive sprite-sheet frame index from any numeric channel — e.g. `MicVolume → frame` for proportional mouth-opening, or `MouthOpen → frame` once webcam ships. (b) `stateMap` mapping type alongside `linear` — a discrete-value lookup table so `MicPhoneme stateMap {A: 0, I: 1, U: 2, E: 3, O: 4} → frame` lets one sprite-sheet sprite express full phoneme lipsync with no state-machine plumbing. Auto-advance fps is the fallback when no `frame` binding fires; bound frame wins. UI extension: `TransformBindingRow` grows a key/value editor branch when target is `frame` or mapping kind is `stateMap`.
   - Why bundled: webcam + frame-bindings together unlock the canonical "single sprite, sheet of mouths, vowel-driven lipsync" rig pattern in one phase. Independently they're each useful; together they replace what currently needs ~5 separate sprites with separate bindings.
5. **Editor UX** — visual binding editor, region editor, hotkey assignment UI, undo/redo. The "rigging stops feeling bad" milestone. *Shipped as 5a (undo/redo with snapshot history + 250ms coalescing). Visual binding editor, region editor, and hotkey UI were already in passable shape from earlier phases.*
6. **Mouse + animations** — mouse input source, tween-on-event animation system, keyboard-region → animation flow. Bongo Cat-style demo works. **Trigger-on-event sprite-sheet playback** (deferred 3g — "press T → play wave once, return to frame 0") lands here since it's the same state-machine concept as keyboard-region animations.
   - *Shipped 6a (mouse input source — MouseX/Y canvas-normalized, MouseLeft/Right/Middle, MouseInside).*
   - *Shipped 6b (event-triggered animation system — Animation type with channel triggers, tween or sheetRange bodies, oneShot or holdActive modes; AnimationRunner pre-computes overlays per tick; pipeline slot between bindings and modifiers; InputBus version counter so latched event channels like KeyEvent fire on each press).*
   - 6c (next): **Bongo Cat validation** — exercise the whole stack end-to-end with a multi-sprite rig (regions + animations + sheet swaps), surface paper cuts, ship a "Load Demo" affordance so users can see a working sample without authoring from scratch.
7. **Clipping layers** — per-sprite `clipBy: SpriteId` field; clipped sprite renders only where the mask sprite has alpha > 0. Solves "eyes within head shape," "mouth within face shape," "lens tint within glasses." Pixi 8 sprite-mask in alpha mode for the runtime; Properties-panel picker for the UI. Foundational rigging primitive — needs to land before pose bindings (riggers will want to clip the freely-transformed sprite) and before PNGTuber+ import (the source rigs likely use clipping).
8. **Pose bindings + free transform** — currently each transform binding drives one property with a linear range, so a "head tilts forward" rig needs three separate bindings (rotation + Y-shift + ScaleY) tuned together. Pose bindings collapse that into one: a binding's target is a `Partial<Transform>` plus an optional pivot, the channel value lerps rest → target additively, and editing happens through a free-transform-box overlay on the canvas (drag corners → captures the target shape). Off-center scaling (chin-anchored ScaleY for head-lean perspective) becomes a one-action affordance instead of a multi-binding workaround. Sub-phases:
   - 7a: pose binding runtime + text-field editor
   - 7b: per-binding pivot + canvas pivot dot
   - 7c: free-transform-box overlay (4 corners + 4 edges + rotate handle, drag → capture target)
   - 7d (later, optional): mesh-based 4-corner non-affine for true skew/perspective. Only if the affine version isn't enough.
9. **Streaming polish** — chroma key mode, OBS browser source URL, hotkeys-when-unfocused verified, tray pause toggle, privacy guardrails audited. **Pause-on-hide** sprite-sheet QoL lands here.
   - **Global mouse + keyboard hooks** — Rust-side OS input monitor publishing to the same MouseX/Y/Buttons + KeyEvent/KeyDown/KeyRegion bus channels, so animations + bindings work while the user is in their game / Discord / DAW. Carries the macOS Accessibility prompt and the Wayland degraded-mode caveat. The version-counter edge detection in AnimationRunner already handles re-publishes correctly, so this is purely a source-side change.
10. **PNGTuber+ import** — parse `.png2` zip, map to our schema, the friend's existing avatar opens. Deferred from earlier in the plan because polish > marketing — a tool that's pleasant to use without import beats one that imports easily but feels rough.
11. **Friend ships** — actual user installs and uses it for a real stream.
